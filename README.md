# github-linear-bridge-tests

This is a sample repository to test our Github and Linear integration

## Description

This repo should have the same common automation setup that our main repo has, except that pointing to the `development` branch of [`NomicFoundation/github-linear-bridge`](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/github-linear-bridge).

This includes linting workflows, which c      an be tested by breaking the format of this file.
